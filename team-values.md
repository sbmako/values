# Team Values
*Version 0.9*

These core values are the guiding principles that dictate our team's behavior and actions.
These values define how we approach what we do and how we do it.

>"True craftsmanship is distinguished by the ability to immerse in the detail of the moment, while at the same time keep in view the next step that leads towards the whole.  Not by perfectionism but by 'carefulness'.  Simultaneously solving a problem while searching for new problems.  Dedication and the readiness to allow mistakes in order to gain further knowledge are therefore essential prerequisites. Just as important is the willingness not to take the line of least resistance or to let oneself become demoralized by resistance."

### Integrity
We will be true to ourselves and honest, upright and decent in our dealings with others.  We can be counted on to stand up for what is right, even if it is unpopular, and to behave with honor even when there is no one around to see.  Integrity allows other people to trust us because they know that we value our commitments and seek to live by them.

### Discipline
We deliberately align our energy with our values and priorities.  Through mental practice we focus in on a task before us and let other temptations and distractions pass us by.  Discipline asks that we endure frustration, disappointment, and pain in the service of a higher goal.  Our discipline will not only enable our success, but will raise the level of productivity in others.

### Excellence
We strive for quality or merit in all that we do.  This means we take time, work hard and think carefully about everything we do.  Achievement of excellence commonly requires approximately ten years of dedication comprising about 10,000 hours of deliberate effort.  We are guided by a vision or an ideal, and we do our best to make it a reality.

### Simplicity
Think small not simple.  We center in on that which is important and let go of the rest.  More broadly this is an attitude, an approach to life.  When we approach anything with an attitude of simplicity we strive to keep ourselves focused on the essential core than getting lost in a clutter of distractions and embellishments.  Simplicity helps us maintain clarity of mind and purpose.

### Courage
Being on this team takes courage.  Fiefdoms will be challenged. Rules will be tested. Routines will be broken. Improvements will happen. Change can be hard. Change takes courage
